### **Inspect Before Running**
While every effort has been made to source batch files from reputable public repositories on GitHub, **you should always inspect the code of any batch file before executing it**. Batch files are plain text scripts, and running them can execute commands that modify your system or files.

Some batch scripts can contain harmful code, such as:
- Commands that delete files
- Commands that overwrite system configurations
- Scripts that may expose sensitive information

**Always read and understand what a batch script does before running it.**

If you're unsure about the safety of a particular file, consider running it in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine or a container, or consult an expert.
